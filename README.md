#[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/about)

This is a collection of files that I've used so far to solve
problems on Project Euler.  I was able to solve a few problems
without programming, so not all solutions are accounted for.

You can learn so much from attempting the problems on your own.
Indeed, challenging yourself by solving the problems is the
whole point of Project Euler.  Please don't deprive yourself of
this excellent opportunity by reading someone else's solution.
It is the exploration and subsequent discovery of your own 
solution that makes Project Euler so enjoyable!
